**etlhelper** is a Python ETL library to simplify data transfer into and out of databases.

.. note::  Note: There are a number of breaking changes planned for etlhelper version 1.0. Please pin the version number in your dependency list to avoid disruption and watch the project on GitHub for notification of new releases (in Custom section).

etlhelper makes it easy to run a SQL query via Python and return the results. It is built upon the DBAPI2 specification and takes care of importing drivers, formatting connection strings and cursor management. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to query a relational database with Python.

Release available at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/etlhelper/>`_

This project is maintained by the `British Geological  Survey <http://bgs.ac.uk/>`_
