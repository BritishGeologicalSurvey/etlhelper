# etlhelper

> etlhelper is a Python ETL library to simplify data transfer into and out of databases.

ETL Helper makes it easy to run SQL queries via Python and return the
results.
It takes care of cursor management, importing drivers and formatting connection strings,
while providing memory-efficient functions to read, write and transform data.
This reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to manipulate data within relational
databases with Python.
